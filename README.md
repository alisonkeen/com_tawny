Election Checklist Module

This module was written for creating ACVI "christian values" pre-election checklists under Joomla 3.0. Election Checklists are a way of giving people a quick read on what the different parties' policies are on different issues. The ACVI has historically focused on abortion, euthanasia, gambling, freedom of religion, drug abuse, and freedom to teach our kids about our heritage as a christian country. 

It has a  "checklist" view, and the ticks, crosses and question marks link to a "rationale" view that shows the background to each rating (past votes in parliament and public statements of policy).
